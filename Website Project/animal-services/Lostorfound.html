                If a lost pet is found there are several things you can do to help get the lost pet back home: <br><br>
                1. Bring the lost pet in to our shelter during operational hours. <br><br>
                2. If you cannot move the animal or think that doing so could put you in danger, contact us at (123)456-7890
                so that we can come and take the animal back home. <br> <br>

                Other things to note: <br><br>
                - To increase the chances of reuniting the lost pet with its owner, we will take several measures including photographing 
                  and recording all stray animals, adding their details to our database, showcasing them on our website, and checking for a microchip. <br><br>
                - After taking the stray pet you found to the shelter for processing, you have the option to take care of the animal in your own home. <br><br>
                - Additionally, posting flyers in your neighborhood or the location where you found the pet could also be beneficial. <br><br>
                - If you found an injured stray animal after our operational hours, please take it to a 24/7 vet clinic. <br><br>
